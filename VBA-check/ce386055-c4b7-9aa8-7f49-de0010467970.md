# Form.Repaint Method (Access)

The  **Repaint** method completes any pending screen updates for a specified form. When performed on a form, the **Repaint** method also completes any pending recalculations of the form's controls.
 


## Syntax

 *expression*  . **Repaint**
 

 
 *expression*  A variable that represents a **Form** object.
 

 

### Return Value

Nothing
 

 

## Remarks

Microsoft Access sometimes waits to complete pending screen updates until it finishes other tasks. With the  **Repaint** method, you can force immediate repainting of the controls on the specified form. You can use the **Repaint** method:
 

 

- When you change values in a number of fields. Unless you force a repaint, Microsoft Access might not display the changes immediately, especially if other fields, such as those in an expression in a calculated control, depend on values in the changed fields.
    
 
- When you want to make sure that a form displays data in all of its fields. For example, fields containing OLE objects often don't display their data immediately after you open a form.
    
 
This method doesn't cause a requery of the database, nor does it show new or changed records in the form's underlying record source. You can use the  ** [Requery](form.requery-method-access.md)** method to requery the source of data for the form or one of its controls.
 

 

 **Note**<BR/>   Don't confuse the **Repaint** method with the ** [Refresh](form.refresh-method-access.md)** method, or with the **Refresh** command on the **Records** menu. The **Refresh** method and **Refresh** command show changes you or other users have made to the underlying record source for any of the currently displayed records in forms and datasheets. <BR/>The **Repaint** method simply updates the screen when repainting has been delayed while Microsoft Access completes other tasks. The **Repaint** method differs from the ** [Echo](application.echo-method-access.md)** method in that the **Repaint** method forces a single immediate repaint, while the **Echo** method turns repainting on or off.
 


## Example

The following example uses the  **Repaint** method to repaint a form when the form receives the focus:
 

 

```
Private Sub Form_Activate() 
    Me.Repaint 
End Sub
```
